# Email API Vercel Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem

The email sending API was working perfectly in development but failing in production (Vercel) with the error:

```
ðŸ“„ FastAPI response text: {"detail":"There was an error parsing the body"}
```

## Root Cause

Vercel's Node.js runtime uses FormData/File polyfills that generate multipart boundaries incompatible with FastAPI's parsing expectations. The native FormData in Vercel's serverless environment creates malformed multipart requests.

## Solution

Implemented `formdata-node` library for proper multipart form data handling.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Installed formdata-node package**

   ```bash
   npm install formdata-node
   ```

2. **Updated imports**

   ```typescript
   import { FormData as NodeFormData, File as NodeFile } from "formdata-node";
   ```

3. **Replaced all FormData usage**

   - Changed from native `FormData` to `NodeFormData`
   - Changed from native `File` to `NodeFile`
   - Updated all retry mechanisms to use the same approach

4. **Proper multipart handling**
   - Let `formdata-node` handle Content-Type headers and boundaries
   - Removed manual Content-Type header setting
   - Used `as any` type assertion for fetch body compatibility

### Benefits

- âœ… Consistent multipart boundary generation across environments
- âœ… FastAPI-compatible multipart encoding
- âœ… Reliable file upload handling on Vercel
- âœ… Maintains all existing retry logic and error handling
- âœ… No changes needed to FastAPI backend

### What to Expect

After deployment, the logs should show:

```
ðŸ“¤ Using formdata-node for better multipart compatibility on Vercel...
ðŸ“Ž Added image 0: filename.jpg (size bytes, image/jpeg)
ðŸ“¡ FastAPI response: { status: 200, statusText: 'OK' }
âœ… Email sent successfully
```

Instead of the previous parsing error.

## Testing

Use the updated test script:

```bash
./test-email-api.sh
```

This implementation follows the exact recommendation to use `formdata-node` for server-to-server multipart requests in Vercel's Node.js runtime environment.
